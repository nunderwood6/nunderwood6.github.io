The struggle of the reactionaries, of these &lsquo;friends of order&rsquo; who scowl at us on the street, is to impose this regime on the whole republic. We, in contrast, want to destroy this system.

			<p>The colonial logic of extraction and cruelty that persists today in Guatemala began in the days of the Spanish invasion, when roughly two-thirds of the Maya population died in the conquest and subsequent epidemics. The Spanish claimed vast tracts of land and instituted a brutal system of forced labor, justifying their violence with a racist ideology of criollo superiority.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-9" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:8.5283%;left:34.5893%;width:57.6577%;">
			<p>Maya peoples resisted fiercely, preserving autonomy and communal land holdings in some highland regions. Still, by the end of the colonial period, persistent patterns of exploitation were established in Guatemala:  mono-export, weak government and a lack of infrastructure, and the channeling of wealth to a tiny oligarchy and foreigners. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-10" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:12.2216%;left:36.7904%;width:55.2553%;">
			<p>For Indigenous peoples, independence from Spain in 1821 brought no change for the better. In the words of thousands protesting during observation of the bicentennial in 2021, there was &ldquo;nada que celebrar&rdquo;, or &ldquo;nothing to celebrate&rdquo;. Dispossession and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the tiny elite only accelerated in the ensuing decades with the growth of the plantation economy.  </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-11" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:13.9625%;left:58.8713%;width:12.6126%;">

			<p>As the craze for coffee and sugar accelerated in the late 1800&rsquo;s, so did the expropriation of lands from Indigenous communities. In the Mam highlands, communal land holdings were decimated and forced labor on plantations was widespread.  This 1888 map shows the massive scale of the coffee economy in the altiplano, where almost all land suitable for coffee was carved up into plantations.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-13" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:18.4663%;left:37.1906%;width:55.2553%;">
			<p>During the first half of the 20th century, the Guatemalan government granted massive concessions to foreign capital, especially to U.S. companies. Dictators Manuel Estrada Cabrera(1898-1920) and Jorge Ubico(1931-1944) ceded so many monopolies and priveleges that by 1944, &ldquo;United States companies virtually dictated Guatemala's economic life&rdquo;(Immerman, 57).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-14" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:21.6662%;left:36.1901%;width:56.6066%;">
			<p>First and foremost among the U.S. corporations was United Fruit Company (UFCo), which monopolized banana production, controlled the railroads and  ports, and owned much of the country&rsquo;s best land. By the middle of the 20th century, UFCo owned 42% of  arable land and posted annual profits of more than $65 million, more than twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-15" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:24.4925%;left:37.0905%;width:56.6066%;">
			<p>The repression of the plantation era peaked with the 14-year reign of Ubico, who maintained control with thousands of secret police who routinely murdered and tortured dissidents. Ubico instituted a brutal system of forced labor that ensured UFCo and the coffee plantations a steady supply of cheap labor despite severe, underpaid working conditions.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-16" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:27.7277%;left:40.4922%;width:56.6066%;">
			<p>Finally, in 1944, a student strike snowballed into a popular revolution that toppled Ubico and began what some historians have called the &lsquo;Democratic Spring&rsquo;. For the next ten years, a fragile representative democracy held sway and the feudal domination of the planters and foreign companies was truly challenged for the first time.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-17" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:30.5681%;left:40.7923%;width:55.8559%;">
			<p>President Juan José Arévalo (1945-1951) abolished forced labor, enabled basic freedoms of speech and press, and passed a labor code that enabled union organizing. Yet Arévalo&rsquo;s government limited rural labor unions and failed to truly challenge the foreign monopolies. President Jacobo Árbenz (1951-1954) confronted the landed oligarchy and corporations more aggressively, most notably through the agrarian reform of 1952.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-18" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:33.7186%;left:37.4907%;width:55.8559%;">
			<p>The 1952 Agrarian Reform Law was designed to address the most important and enduring barrier to equality in Guatemala: access to land. The law enabled the expropriation of fallow land from the largest landowners and its distribution to landless citizens. The law was supported by the majority of Indigenous and working class people, and bitterly resisted by the tiny elite, who saw it as an existential threat.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-19" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:37.13%;left:38.9914%;width:55.8559%;">
			<p>No landowner stood to lose more than UFCo, which had only 15% of its sprawling 550,000 acres in active production (Jonas, 27). From the earliest days of the 1944 revolution, UFCo and the landed elite had resented its democratic reforms and plotted its overthrow. UFCo, connected at the highest levels of the Eisenhower administration, finally convinced the U.S. government to overthrow the Arbenz government in 1954.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-20" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:40.4003%;left:39.4917%;width:57.958%;">
			<p>While the Eisenhower administration publically claimed a Communist threat as pretext for the CIA coup, the real aim was to oust Arbenz in favor of a repressive government that would protect the profits of the U.S. monopolies. According to historians, &ldquo;every U.S. policymaking official involved in the decision to overthrow the Guatemalan government, except for President Eisenhower himself, had a family or business connection to United Fruit Company.&rdquo; (Bitter Fruit)</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-21" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:43.6002%;left:35.89%;width:57.958%;">
			<p>The CIA used a mercenary army, aerial bombing, and a barrage of psychological warfare to overthrow Arbenz and install Carlos Castillo Armas in his place. In the months following the coup, the U.S. government warmly embraced Armas as he presided over a bloody counter-revolution that saw thousands of unionists, campesinos, and civil society leaders brutally murdered and imprisoned. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-22" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:46.6451%;left:37.8909%;width:55.8559%;">
			<p>An estimated three to five thousand people were murdered. At UFCo&rsquo;s Finca Jocotán on the south coast, upwards of 1,000 union organizers were rounded up and executed. Campesinos who had participated in the agrarian reform were mercilessly repressed. According to a Ch&rsquo;orti&rsquo; survivor,<span class="g-cstyle0"> &ldquo;When Jacobo Arbenz left there was a great slaughter. Corpses appeared on the roads. In the time of Castillo Armas, the Army went everywhere killing peasants.&rdquo;</span> (CEH 917)</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-23" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:50.0141%;left:37.3092%;width:57.6577%;">
			<p>The 1954 coup kicked off a spiral of violence that would lead to four decades of repression and terror. With democratic progress stifled, guerrilla movements sprang up, and a series of brutal military governments waged war against its own citizens. An estimated 200,000 people were killed and disappeared, and more than 1.5 million displaced during the conflict, according to a U.N.-sponsored truth commission called the Historical Clarification Committee (CEH).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-24" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:53.0942%;left:40.9924%;width:56.6066%;">
			<p>The CEH&rsquo;s 4,000+ page report, based on the testimony of survivors, recorded thousands of human rights violations  and concluded that 93% were committed by the government forces. These included more than 600 massacres, formally defined by the CEH as &ldquo;the arbitrary execution of more than five people, carried out in the same place and as part of the same operation, when the victims were in a state of absolute or relative defenselessness.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-25" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:90.203%;right:5.9156%;width:13.0631%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle4">Indigenous</p>

		<div id="g-ai2-26" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:90.351%;right:5.9164%;width:11.5616%;">

		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-27" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:92.4866%;left:34.5345%;width:54.8048%;">
			<p>The CEH&rsquo;s landmark report was only made possible by the dedication and bravery of the witnesses and organizers, who fought for justice despite great personal peril. Many of the recruiters and interviewers belonged to popular movement organizations such as the AEU (San Carlos Student Association), GAM (Mutual Aid Group), CUC (Committee for Peasant Unity), and CONAVIGUA (National Association of Guatemalan Widows), human rights groups whose members were criminalized and murdered during the conflict.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-28" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:95.2354%;left:35.8859%;width:55.7057%;">
			<p>Despite heroic efforts to expose state-sponsored violence, the publication of the truth commision&rsquo;s report did not signal a new age of accountability and justice in Guatemala. Impunity was built into the CEH from the start, as it was bound by its creation to avoid naming individual perpetrators. The recommendations of the CEH, like the broader commitments of the Peace Accords, were never really implemented, and prosecution of war criminals has been delayed and obstructed at every turn.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai2-29" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:98.1745%;left:37.5375%;width:57.0571%;">
			<p>From the devastation of the colonial invasion, to the exploitation of the plantation era, to the genocidal violence of the armed conflict, a history of invasion has left deep scars in Indigenous communities. The structural inequality that drives the migration of Maya children like Claudia, Jakelin, Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos is inextricably linked to this history&mdash;especially since the cycle of invasion has continued in the post-war era.</p>
