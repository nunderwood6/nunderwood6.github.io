			<p class="g-pstyle1">&ldquo;What we are facing today is not so different from what happened before, and instead is the continuation of a policy designed to appropriate our natural resources....When the Peace Accords were signed, an underlying objective was to benefit big business, transnational corporations, mega-projects, and the global economy. It was in the interest of global and transnational capital to end the war and to clean up our lands in order to implement their projects. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t explained this way. The existence of an economic agenda was hidden.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle1">&mdash;Rigoberto Juárez Mateo,  Maya Q&rsquo;anjob&rsquo;al ancestral authority</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-3" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:11.0646%;left:38.4086%;width:54.8726%;">
			<p>Democracy and dignity have remained under attack in Guatemala&rsquo;s post-war period. The 1996 Peace Accords promised to address socioeconomic disparities, protect human rights, and create a multicultural state with equal rights for Indigenous peoples.  Instead, the peace process paved the way for a new stage of invasion marked by the intensification of extractive capitalism, the empty promises of neoliberal multiculturalism, and the violent repression of land, water, and human rights defenders.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-4" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:17.9997%;left:40.1186%;width:54.7226%;">
			<p>The rhetoric of multiculturalism promoted by the state has proven hollow.  According to Kaqchiquel anthropologist Rigoberto Ajcalón Choy, &ldquo;the Guatemalan state began to tolerate certain indigenous claims, especially to cultural rights, but it was unwilling to accept their economic rights, particularly those related to the struggle for territory and resources-oil, water, forests, minerals, plants, and animals, among others- because these affect dominant-sector interests and interfere with the government's plan to promote capitalist investments&rdquo;.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-5" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:21.0315%;left:15.9583%;width:31.6342%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle2">End story with fact that justice has not been served&mdash;for Claudia, for the survivors of the genocide, and for those who fight for justice and struggle to survive in Guatemala today.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-6" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:26.2067%;left:33.226%;width:55.7721%;">
			<p>While the Guatemalan government paid lip service to Indigenous rights, a wave of neoliberal economic reforms in the 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s ensured the continued domination of the elite and transnational corporations. These reforms included the privatization of public services, the passage of mining laws biased towards the interests of foreign capital, and the passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in 2005.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-7" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:33.4205%;left:34.726%;width:55.7721%;">
			<p>When U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Guatemala in March of 1999, just weeks after the release of the CEH report, he broke with previous policy by admitting and apologizing for the role of the U.S. in the human rights abuses of the war. Clinton promised to &ldquo;support the peace and reconciliation process in Guatemala&rdquo;, a promise contradicted in the years since by the maintenance of close ties with the corrupt elite, the promotion of a development agenda that prioritizes corporate profits over human rights, and the escalation of the destructive policy of border militarization.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-8" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:42.7426%;left:36.2138%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>In 2005, a U.S. Congressman lauded CAFTA as the &ldquo;the best immigration, anti-gang, and anti-drug policy at our disposal&rdquo;, claiming like other advocates that the agreement would materially improve the lives of Guatemalans, reduce violence, and empower workers. Instead, CAFTA flooded Central America with cheap U.S. agricultural exports, displacing millions of rural workers who couldn&rsquo;t compete against subsidized agro-business. Nor did conditions for workers improve. In 2018, the International Trade Union Confederation labeled Guatemala &ldquo;one of the worst violations of workers&rsquo; rights, with widespread and systemic violence against workers and trade unionists&rdquo;.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-9" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:47.0291%;left:37.4192%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>Today&rsquo;s targeted repression against activists, Indigenous leaders, and environmental defenders bears a striking resemblance to the abuses of the past. From 2018 to 2020, a Guatemala NGO dedicated to tracking violence against activists documented 57 murders, many in Maya communities that suffered massacres during the war (UDEFEGUA). Hundreds more were the targets of threats, intimidation, and criminalization by corporate and state actors.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-10" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:57.9543%;left:34.6696%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>Abandoned by the government, struggling to make ends meet, and facing retaliation for resistance, many choose to migrate in search of dignity and security abroad. But many also choose to stay, continuing a tradition of resistance and survival, refusing to be separated from their lands, raising their voices and organizing to demand change.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-11" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:66.0394%;left:37.818%;width:58.3208%;">
			<p>Near Felipe Gómez Alonzo&rsquo;s village of Yalambojoch, the Peaceful Resistance of the Microregion of Ixquisis continue to defend their territory from the unlawful development of a hydroelectric dam. They are one of many Indigenous communities across Guatemala demanding that the government honor their right to &ldquo;prior, free, and informed consent&rdquo; as guaranteed by law, and halt extractive mega-projects that destroy the land and leave communities impoverished.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-12" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:72.7304%;left:35.7191%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>Organizing in the streets  and advocating change through art, Guatemalans continue to demand an end to discrimination against Indigenous peoples, women, and the poor. Leaders like Kaqchikel singer Sara Curruchich exemplify the resolve of Indigenous women, who she says should be considered &ldquo;actors of change, fundamental actors for the prevalence of our Indigenous knowledge, and a pillar of sustainability for our communities and for the entire country, for the world&rdquo;.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-13" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:82.2443%;left:35.7191%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>Transnational advocacy networks continue to struggle against border militarization and the criminalization of migrants, which compound insecurity and result in the death and disappearance of thousands each year. Groups including the Caravan of Mothers of Missing Migrants are drawing attention to the cruelty of immigration enforcement regimes, while others such as the ACLU are demanding justice for the deaths of Claudia and other migrant youth.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-14" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:89.946%;left:35.1194%;width:56.8216%;">
			<p>Despite criminalization, communities continue to defend their lands and denounce the corruption of the state and economic elite, whose power is visible in institutions such as the CACIF, a coalition of business elites that &ldquo;essentially exerts a veto power on undesirable economic policies&rdquo;. Led by defenders like Q&rsquo;eqchi&rsquo; schoolteacher Bernardo Caal Xol, recently released after four years of imprisonment for environmental defense, the people continue to struggle against extractivism, impunity, and structural racism.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-15" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:96.9158%;left:39.6171%;width:53.6732%;">
			<p>The mass exodus that claimed the lives of Claudia, Jakelin, Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos will end only when their voices are heard. Until then, the people will continue to fight, in memory of those who came before, and on behalf of those to come, for the right to dignified life in Guatemala.</p>
